# AdvertsManager

The Adverts Manager Project is an open-source initiative designed to provide developers with an easy means of integrating Google AdMob and Unity Ads into their applications. This project includes two custom classes aimed at facilitating the utilization of these features.

The classes support the following types of ads:

- AdmobManager.java
  - Banner
  - Interstitial
  - Rewarded

- UnityManager.java
  - Banner
  - Interstitial
  - Rewarded

It is worth noting that the project is still under development. Those interested in contributing to its enhancement can access the repository on GitHub through the application settings.
